# todo List

A simple todo list in the console, purely made for learning, not for serious use.
Only compatible with Linux based systems due to the use of specific symbolic link.

## How to build

To build, type within the todo directory:
```
make
```
## Miscellaneous
To remove the object directory:
```
make clean-obj
```
To remove all content produced with the Makefile, including list.txt:
```
make clean
```
